 you manage to find a functioning ship.
 Looks like freedom is yours.
 You practically melt into the soft
 pilot's seat, a luxurious welcome
 as you leave this wretched rock.
 The ship rumbles as she wakes up;
 you think of Earth as she lifts off.
 
 Hopefully AGM won't find you there:
 they've got the outbreak to deal with,
 so that'll give you some time.
 
 Destination: Earth!"
